### Summary

I added action nodes for behavior state machines: set blackboard value to actor or source, set FSM current state, and run FSM transition with conditions. This lets zombies target the player who enters an area.

I changed the spawn action random radius from float to Vector3, so the distance in each axis can be set individually. This allows spawning with some random offset but maintaining the same axial distribution.

I split up footstep effects for players and zombies - made the zombie footsteps louder and player footsteps quieter.

I added a slime enemy that splits into two smaller slimes when it dies. I added an option to spawn new entities under the current entity's parent. Since scenes cannot recursively contain themselves, the slime cannot directly spawn more of itself.

I added CLI arguments to select the debug level and spawn point. Only applies in debug builds. Level name must exist in the root game node's level scenes dictionary.

I split up the door action and lock action. Door action now just opens and closes. Lock action can lock or unlock anything, not just doors, and can also change the key needed for a lock.

I fixed the baseball bat not hitting breakable glass or doors. These are prefabs where the entity is not the root of the scene. The bat was colliding with the physics body and calling that action method instead of checking for a parent entity.

### Progress

- added action nodes for behavior state machines
	- set blackboard value to actor or source (f.ex, zombies can target player who enters an area)
	- set FSM current state to state
	- run FSM transition with conditions (like a softer version of set-state that respects any conditions within the transition table)
- changed the spawn action random radius from float to Vector3, so the distance in each axis can be set individually
	- allows spawning with some random offset but maintaining the same axial distribution (flat, vertical, etc)
- split up footstep effects for players and zombies
	- made the zombie footsteps louder and player footsteps quieter
- added a slime enemy that splits into two smaller slimes when it dies
	- added option to spawn new entities under the current entity's parent
	- scenes cannot recursively contain themselves, so the slime cannot directly spawn more of itself
	- need to find a way to adjust the primary color without making new materials
- added CLI arguments to select the debug level and spawn point
	- only applies in debug mode/builds
	- `./godot -- --level=String --marker=NodePath` to load a level and spawn at the given marker
		- for example, `./exports/ZombieGame.x86_64 -- --level=1_hotel --marker=Markers/FrontDoor`
	- level name must exist in the root game node's level scenes dictionary, this cannot be used to load arbitrary scenes by path or from disk
- split up door action and lock action
	- door action now opens and closes
	- lock action can lock or unlock anything, not just doors
	- lock action can also change the key needed for a lock
- fixed baseball bat not hitting breakable glass or door
	- these are both prefabs where the entity is not the root of the scene and contains the physics body (rather than the entity node also being a physics body type)
	- the bat was colliding with the physics body and calling that action method
	- checking the collider for a parent entity before calling the actions fixed it
- make the entity removal helper deferred by default
	- this should help prevent confusion situations where an entity is removed in between two ECS systems or queries and suddenly goes missing

### TODOs

- [x] the baseball bat is not hitting the breakable door because it collides with the physics body and does not check for a parent entity
	- this eventually leads the action node to call `run_physics` on the body instead of `run_entity` on the entity
- clean up zombie death sequence
	- add ragdoll action node to unlock physics
- [x] refactor lock flags out of door action
	- any entity can be locked/unlocked
- [x] switch trigger area from polling to timers
	- timer as child of the entity, gets removed with it
	- area can track timers and remove them on exit
- [x] make the trigger area track current colliders
- [x] add actions to replace actor with:
	- [x] all entities in area
	- [x] source as actor
	- [x] specific entity
- [x] refactor out any `is ZE_*` checks to use components
- [x] reduce zombie logging, or figure out why they are so chatty
- [x] make register messages not debug (no stack frame)
