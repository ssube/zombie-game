### Summary

Mostly a day off. Did some baking and work around the house, went out to dinner with my partner. Took my desk apart and moved it back into my office.

I created a rain effect that is centered above the player for outdoor storms and worked on figuring out and documenting a save format that will include ECS relationships and inventory entities.
