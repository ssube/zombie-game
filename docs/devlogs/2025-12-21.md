### Summary

Retrospective devlog. I worked on a few smaller ideas on this day but did not write a full devlog at the time.

I added a dripping water prefab with water screen effect and added support for multiple sounds to the audio action with random and all play modes.

I committed the custom zombie game tools: fix collision mesh, sort components, check lock keys, and check objective keys. These help with level editing and validation.

I refactored the health/damage systems, moving some handler code from the health system to the health observer to run less often. I started adding more combat relationships: fired for the actor that launched a projectile and killed for the actor that killed an entity.

I enforced "conservation of experience" by removing experience after it has been transferred to prevent farming. I also added better support for overlapping screen effects - leaving each effect area will only remove one effect with the correct type and strength.

### Progress

- added a dripping water prefab with water screen effect
- add support for multiple sounds to the audio action
	- with random and all play modes
- commit the custom zombie game tools
	- `fix collision mesh` resizes the mesh and resets the node's scale, to fix collision meshes that were created from scaled models/created at the wrong scale
	- `sort components` will sort the component resources on an entity by class name
	- `check lock keys` will check the current scene to make sure all lock components refer to a valid key name that exists in the level (assumes the scene is a level)
	- `check objective keys` will check the current scene to make sure all objective components refer to a valid objective key that exists in the level (assumes the scene is a level)
- refactor health/damage systems
	- move some handler code from health system to health observer to run less often
	- start adding more combat relationships:
		- `fired` for the actor that launched a projectile
		- `killed` for the actor that killed an entity
- enforce some "conservation of experience" by removing experience after it has been transferred
	- removes all experience from the transfer source after adding it to the target
	- some experience can still be lost, due to the transfer ratio, but this should prevent most forms of farming
- better support for overlapping screen effects
	- leaving each effect area will only remove one effect with the correct type and strength
