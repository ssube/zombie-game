### Summary

I figured out how to link melee damage to the source. Trigger areas now have a link to their parent entity, and relationship utils now includes a get_wielder method to find the entity currently wielding a weapon.

I added a console menu with one command for now: `load [level_key]`.

I started a spooky church level and moved level calculation into an observer.
