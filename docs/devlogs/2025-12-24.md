### Summary

I added a weather resource that includes time of day, weather type, and environment/sky scene. Each level can have a list of them and the best option is selected from the level, falling back to the observer.

I made styles match for the loading and end menus: added translucent background to level end and game over screens, added opaque background to loading scene, and centered the contents.

I added a puddle that appears during thunder weather with footstep splash subtitles. I also improved the water drip effect with a puddle visual, made it extinguish fire effects, and made the drip noise match the particle effect.

I added idle comments to the hotel clerk (subtitles only, no audio yet).

I tied the vignette effect to the player's stamina - the layer becomes more opaque and narrower as stamina runs out.

I added more options to the options menu: CRT shader resolution and mouse sensitivity.

I worked on the spooky church level: improved the fog effect, added floating objects inside, added trees in front, and made the front stairs walkable. I worked on test town adding static cars, and started a bus stop level with a street corner and 2 bus stops.

I added a wobble effect to the objective sphere and implemented the god mode and no aggro cheats.
