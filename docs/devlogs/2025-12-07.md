### Summary

Some misc fixes today. I implemented armor items with damage multipliers, tested the animation player for cutscenes, and started working on the options menu. I also figured out how to handle sounds that are playing when their entity is removed - by moving them up to the parent node.

I split up the interaction sounds into pickup and use categories, and created sound-specific scenes that include the sound and subtitles together.

### Armor

Implemented armor with one basic box pickup. Armor immediately applies a damage multiplier to the player, but real Quake-style armor should contribute to a pool of armor points that do damage soak (immunity but armor can be depleted).

The types of armor should be flagged somehow, either by value (soak > 0 and multiplier != 1.0) or by flags (has_soak and has_multiplier).

While implementing armor, I merged a few areas where damage was being applied into a single helper function. The helper checks to make sure the target has health, calculates the current damage multiplier/armor ratio, and adds a damage relationship for the final damage amount.

Fire bypasses armor for now and the damage applied by fire is not reduced by armor.

### Cutscenes

Tested the animation player for cutscenes, it seems like it should work and will make most of the effects easier, but some path follow nodes might still be helpful. Animations can invoke methods, so things like attaching the player to a car can probably be implemented that way. With some of those attachments, physics will need to be disabled or bypassed during the cutscenes, so the player does not collide with the car.

#### Intro Cutscene

Once the intro cutscene ends, the fake car should be replaced with a real one at the same position (in the same parking space).

### Projectiles

I started thinking about how to clean up the projectile impact code, which currently duplicates some logic between the projectile service and the decal manager.

It might be a good idea to combine the projectile impact visual and sound nodes into a single scene. Since the visual lasts longer than the sound, the sound node will stick around a little bit longer, but will only play once and reduce the number of individual scenes by one. More importantly, the projectile service has a table of surface types and sounds, duplicating the table in the decal manager. Renaming the decal manager is probably not necessary yet, but since decals are already split up by surface type, including the sound in the decal scene is probably best.

The biggest problem with that change is that subtitles are currently applied by the code that plays the sound, not by the sound itself. I noticed that the code is missing the distance check, so unifying the play-sound, check-distance, and push-subtitle code would be a good idea.

Surface detection for decals is not really set up yet. If FuncGodot supports group membership, that would be the easiest option.

Update: FuncGodot does support groups through the `node_groups` property in the FGD definition. This requires the brush in Trenchbroom to be a brush entity, but then the brush will be added to the right layer group and node groups. That still does not provide a way to group by surface, however.

### Sounds

I figured out how to handle sounds that are playing when their entity is removed: move them up to the parent, or if it was an action by the player, attach them to that player. This is a recursive search of the node tree, which may become slow if characters are complicated scenes, but will keep all of the sound nodes until they are finished playing. A signal callback is bound to the `finished` signal, so when the sound does stop, it will be removed. That might break some looping sounds, but for now, none of the entities have a looping pickup/use sound.

Interaction sounds have been split into pickup and use, and weapons will use the use sound as an equip sound as well. Using items from your inventory will either consume or equip them, same as right-clicking them in the world, so sharing the same sound effect also makes sense.

I have temporarily given up on making sounds part of larger scenes and have set up sound-specific scenes that are still played by the code when they are created, but include the sound and subtitles. This makes it easier to share sounds between multiple entities without recreating the subtitles and volume every time.

### Options

I started implementing the options menu. Most of the options are wired up, except for the audio options and window mode.
