### Summary

I added a way for the FSM to call actions when it enters/exits a state by adding STATE_ENTER and STATE_EXIT action types. This allows sounds to be set up outside of the FSM scene by linking them to the entity's actions.

I added a color utils with a method to get a named color from the zombie palette, falling back to Godot color names if not found. I added the named colors into the dialogue helpers as a bbcode.

I fixed the sparkle crown to only enable while worn using particle actions tied to the equip/unequip events. I added more static foliage (a bush and a dead tree) and made sure you can't reach the pistol through the window of the fishing pier cabin.

I set up the laptop for potato testing, fixed the fishing pier railing, and automatically enabled cheats in debug mode.

I added coyote time for jumping in the IKCC controller (potentially with an increased stamina cost as you get closer to the end). I added a physics thread check/warning in the IKCC. I also added a text dialog for books, signs, etc using a custom menu where the others are hidden and the game is optionally paused.

### Progress

- [x] add a way for the FSM to call actions when it enters/exits a state
	- this is done in the most basic sense, by adding the STATE_ENTER and STATE_EXIT action types
	- that does not provide any info about the old or new state, which would probably be helpful but requires a context class
	- it does allow the sounds to be set up outside of the FSM scene, by linking them to the entity's actions
- [x] add a color utils with a method to get a named color
	- the color utils should have an internal list of named colors in the zombie palette
	- if a color is not found, fall back to the Godot color names
	- internal names could use `_name` or `zombie_name`
- [x] only enable sparkle crown while worn
	- using particle actions tied to the equip/unequip events
- [x] add more static foliage
	- [x] a bush
	- [x] a dead tree
- ~~make sure puddles don't have collision~~
	- they need to have some collision in order to detect impacts, unless I can do that with an area
- ~~fix the glass material on the bus stop level~~
	- make it translucent and hide any duplicate surfaces
	- because the map is being imported as large meshes, making the glass transparent causes sorting problem
	- I also don't think it looks very good, after testing at different levels of transparency from 50-95%
- [x] make sure you can't reach the pistol through the window of the fishing pier cabin
- [x] add the named colors into the dialogue helpers or as a bbcode
	- [x] add a bbcode
	- [x] name the colors
- [x] commit the materials in the textures folder
	- [x] need to modify the gitignore to include res/tres within the textures folder
- [x] set up the laptop for potato testing
- [x] fix the fishing pier railing
- [x] automatically enable cheats in debug mode
- [x] Physics thread check/warning in the IKCC
	 - If this is required, we'll move move and slide to the physics thread if the velocity component is non zero
 - [x] Coyote time for jumping in the IKCC
	- Potentially with an increased stamina cost as you get closer to the end
- [x] Text dialog for books, signs, etc (or use the dialogue system)
	- This could use a custom menu, where the others are hidden and the game optionally paused, with one or more exit buttons.
	- The buttons would fire a use event with their id as part of the extra data

### Next Up


- Double jump could be a thing too
- [x] climbing ladders
- zombies are not turning smoothly to follow the player
	- they turn in chunks, like they only turn in between other states
- the zombie equipment errors are still happening somewhat often
	- except when I'm trying to reproduce them
	- happening quickly -on the debug level
	- possibly something to do with the spawner
- Collectibles throughout the maps, maybe the hats to start with
	- menu to track your progress
	- persist with the game options?
		- this works best with the idea of a player profile
- remove mesh data from scenes
	- doing this breaks the create collision shape from mesh button
	- unless you save out the mesh resources
- move statics out of entities entirely
- figure out where the crosshair settings should go (probably into their own component)
	- this also means another large migration of component data, in particular the crosshair colors assigned to various entities
