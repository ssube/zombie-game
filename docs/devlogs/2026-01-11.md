### Summary

I added shadow options to the graphics menu with three settings: none, low, and high. These are controlled by global groups that developers can use to tag lights as low or high priority for shadows.

Environmental hazards can now have custom cause of death messages. The game over screen shows messages like "Killed by being run over by Red Car" when you stand in front of the car on the fishing pier level. This can be used for acid pools, lava, and other deadly areas.

Containers have been hard to spot, so I enabled the shimmer effect when you are near one to help highlight them in the world. The level screenshot tool also moved into the addon to remove another use of EditorInterface from the main game code.

The skin and weather systems had their own local node toggling functions, so I replaced them with a single helper in TreeUtils. This consolidates the logic for disabling visuals, areas, collision, and processing on nodes.

Finally, I cleaned up the scene files by removing embedded mesh data that was making the git repository and diffs larger than necessary.

### Progress

- added shadows to the options menu
	- there are three settings: none, low, and high
	- this controls the number of lights that will use shadows
	- for developers, the shadows are controlled by two global groups, `shadow_low` and `shadow_high`. Adding a light to either of these groups will enable shadows when the setting is set to an equal or greater value.
- added support for a custom cause of death to script triggers and areas in the world that do damage
	- the game over screen will show "Killed by being run over by Red Car" now when you stand in front of the car on the fishing pier level
	- can be used for pools of acid ("being corroded by Acid") or lava ("being melted by Lava") or even outer space ("being ejected by Airlock")
	- I plan to add some more options for the formatting
- enable the shimmer effect when you are near a container
	- this will help highlight containers in the world
	- I wanted to test the proximity shimmer feature
- moved the level screenshot tool into the addon
	- this was another place where `EditorInterface` was being used that has been removed from the main game code
- replaced numerous functions for disabling nodes with a single helper
	- skins and weather had their own helpers, which did slightly different things
	- this can disable visuals, areas, collision, and processing on the target nodes
- removed mesh data from the scenes
	- a lot of the scene files had some mesh data in them, which was making the git repository and diffs larger than they should have been

### TODOs

- [ ] add contact and credits to the menu somewhere
- [x] write todos for the results of the player testing
	- [ ] increase the damage done by the melee weapons or decrease the zombie's health
	- [ ] decrease the damage that surfaces do to the crowbar
	- [ ] fix the crowbar not colliding with the floating cardboard boxes
	- [ ] add a sound when the player is exhausted and cannot perform an action 
	- [ ] the crowbar is using the sound effect for the bat when it breaks
	- [ ] bullet holes appear on the invisible walls around the level (need to assign no decal to them)
	- [ ] color code the actions in the top bar (player missed the notification about getting the shotgun)
	- [ ] play a pickup sound when getting items out of a container (same as above )
	- [ ] Shotgun has too much physics again, pushing medkits through the floor (might need to freeze ranged weapons in static mode)
	- [ ] Need to limit how far adaptive aim can turn the gun on the near side (weird behavior when looking up or standing against a wall)
	- [ ] Curb near the red car in the bus stop level is weird, can't walk up it sometimes, the effect stops at the vertical line on the brick building 
	- [ ] Buttons on the new save menu are positioned wrong
	- [ ] Creating a new save with an existing name does not ask if you want to replace the old one
	- [ ] Right click to interact was not intuitive and should have a keyboard shortcut (maybe F)
- [ ] zombie equipment errors
	- `W 0:00:44:334   Logger.gd:49 @ log_level(): 2026-01-10T16:22:11 - WARNING - Unable to equip weapon: ZombieMelee
- [ ] prepare the list of resource credits for the demo
	- [ ] freesound audio
	- [ ] itch assets
	- [ ] opengameart textures
	- [ ] editor icons
	- [ ] shaders
	- [ ] IKCC
	- [ ] anything else that needs to be included

### Next Up

- [ ] quick save and quick load hotkeys
- [ ] add a `spawn` console command
- [ ] the cars need to emit sounds more often or continuously (w.r.t attention)
- [ ] make sure all of the lights have a shadow group
- [ ] start splitting up readme into sections
	- [ ] Itch link for players
	- [ ] game features for mod makers and players
    - [ ] new nodes for Godot developers
    - [ ] systems for GECS developers
- [ ] outline deep dives
    - [ ] level building for map makers
    - [ ] weapon building for mod makers
- [ ] actions refactor
	- [ ] move actions into their own folder with conditions, triggers, mutations, etc
	- [ ] start refactoring actions to use the context class
- [ ] add a scripted car with variable speed curve
	- [ ] should have a wait timer that starts when it comes to a stop, which can be the shuffle timer
- [ ] make melee weapons visible within the camera bounds at idle/resting position
- [ ] add behavior for passive/unaware zombies
- [ ] push assets to a private repo
	- [ ] build automation
	- [ ] could use Github Actions if I give it credentials to download the assets bundle from somewhere
- [ ] stylized book menu

### Ideas

- [ ] add a bloom or glow shader for some of the night levels
- [ ] animated crate lids
- [ ] add a strength slider or sliders for the CRT shader

### Menu System 

One thing that has been bothering me for a while is how closely integrated the menus are with many of the other systems in the game. These are systems that need to update the menu for some reason (equipping a weapon, updating the ammo counter, etc) but they all call into the menus whenever they need to, and some use the tree utils to get a reference to the menus. This has also led the script for the menu scene to have over a dozen methods that take a parameter and pass it on to one of the child menus.

I see a few solutions: 
1. A menu manager to keep track of the menu nodes, their state, visibility, etc.
2. Access to the individual menus via the menu scene.
3. A way for menus to be notified of changes - this works when they are active, but not when they are disabled.
4. A way for menus to examine the world.

There are a few other problems with menus that are closely related: 

- They do not have any context about the player who opened them for inventory and
