### Summary

I cleaned up the debug map using brush entities with occlusion culling. I implemented the inventory menu so you can use items by double-clicking or pressing enter. I also added an exit confirmation dialog that shows time since your last save.

I made inventory items hide and disable physics when picked up, and fixed them to follow the player in 3D space. Also added a mockup zombie city worker with a hardhat and flashlight to test how enemies look when carrying lights.

### Progress

- cleaned up the debug map using brush entities
	- each room is now its own entity with occlusion culling
- added a fallback for levels without a specific spawn point
	- the node at `Markers/Start` will be used if the spawn point is not found
	- empty spawn points (`""`) are now invalid
- hide inventory items and disable physics
	- this should be a fairly effective way of "removing" inventory items from the world while keeping their nodes intact
	- ~~this does not make them follow the player in 3D space, so effects/areas will still be spawned at the wrong location (0, 0, 0)~~
	- fixed the items so they will follow the player in 3D space
- fixed the shader toggle in the pause menu
- reset the time on the shimmer shader every time you focus on a new interactive item
	- the shimmer will always start in the same place within its own calculation
	- because the shimmer is using global coordinates rather than local ones, it still does not start in the same relative location across different items placed in the world
- implemented the inventory menu
	- you can now use items by double-clicking them in the inventory menu or pressing enter with the item selected
	- the menu keeps a list of players and their items, which is updated when the menu opens
	- this uses a relationship (the ZC_Used component) to link the item to the player for the player system to handle later
	- the only downside is that the player system does not run while the game is paused and the inventory menu pauses the game, so you can queue up multiple uses of the same item while in the menu and they all run when the game resumes
	- similarly, item usage sounds do not play until the game resumes
	- items are not removed from the inventory list after being used
- added an exit confirmation dialog
	- prevents you from accidentally clicking quit when you meant to click save
	- acts as a normal menu, with back and quit buttons
	- shows the time since your last save in an offset format
	- should use a more natural duration (X hours or X minutes)
- added a mockup zombie city worker with hardhat and flashlight
	- testing how it looks when enemies are carrying lights
	- this zombie has an orange hardhat and a yellow flashlight
- hide the ammo label when a melee weapon is equipped

### TODOs

- make the shimmer shader more consistent
- improve the format of the duration in the exit confirmation dialog
- ~~make player inventory items follow them in 3D space~~

### Next Up

- [x] cheats manager (no clip, god mode, no aggro)
- [x] screen effects (on hit, under water, etc)
