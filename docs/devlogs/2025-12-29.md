### Summary

I added a level select menu, hooked up to the new game button in the start menu for now. I also added a flag to skip the start menu in debug mode, though it defaults to off.

I added menu audio: a background loop with higher and lower pitched sections, and button click sounds applied to many buttons.

I fixed the player aim so shots hit where the crosshair is pointing. Previously, the weapon's fixed angle made it inaccurate at long distances. Now the weapon marker points at the collision point of the interaction raycast, which matches the on-screen target. If there is no collision, the weapon marker points at the end of the ray. I added a game option to make this lerp and adjust more slowly, with a slider in the options menu.

I added a barrel of fire to the roadside in the fishing pier level and made the fishing pier stairs walkable.

### Progress

- [x] level select menu
	- hooked up to the new game button in  the start menu for now
- [x] flag to skip start menu in debug mode
	- defaults to off, which shows the start menu and level select
- [x] barrel of fire
	- added to the roadside in the fishing pier level
- [x] menu audio
	- [x] menu background audio
		- using a two-part ambient loop with higher and lower pitched sections
	- [x] button click sound
		- applied to many buttons, but not all of them yet
- [x] player aim fix
	- the player's weapon aim is relatively accurate for targets that are nearby, but becomes much less accurate at long distances due to the fixed angle of the weapon. since the angle of the weapon controls the angle of the projectile that it fires, due to the muzzle marker, this makes it difficult to snipe the zombies. one possible fix is to adjust the angle of the weapon marker to point at the collision point of the interaction raycast, which matches the on-screen target. if there is no collision, the weapon marker will point out at the end of the ray. this will keep the weapon pointed at the closest surface in front of the player's target reticle, for a what-you-see-is-what-you-hit experience
    - [x] weapon should aim at the point of contact for the interaction ray, which needs to be much longer
    - [x] that ray is already checked on every frame by the player system
    - [x] the ray needs to check each items Interaction radius before selecting it
    - [x] the weapon node looks at the closest collision or the end of the ray
    - [x] game option to make this lerp and adjust more slowly
    - [x] add a slider to the options menu
    - [x] fix transform lerp
- [x] make the fishing pier stairs walkable

### Next up

- Stealth movement - short camera
    - need to move camera to an offset position before applying rotation to head and hands
    - could add a node above the head that moves for jump and crouch
    - they will need a curve for each action with some overshoot when you land
- [x] Flare projectile with effects
    - [x] Particles for fire and sparks
    - [x] light with shadows
    - [x] ignite props and mobs
- Rock weapon
    - Small pile of rocks, throw one at a time
    - Can find more ammo on the ground
- ~~Stick weapon~~
    - Simple geometry, wood texture
    - Low durability, easy to find in the world
    - can't find a model for this one yet
- [x] Crowbar weapon
	- [x] model with metal texture
	- [x] metal impact noise
- animated car
    - path following with constant or variable speed
    - [x] car model with damage areas in front
    - lights with shadows
    - [x] moving engine loop
    - [ ] adjust engine volume based on speed
    - tire noise while turning
    - dynamic brake lights
    - [x] hide after path ends, until reset (looping with gap)
- kill streak service
	- using time elapsed, reset every time there is a new killed by relationship
	- updates a counter for each player and possibly some bosses
	- the counter should be a persistent component
	- counter should be keyed by kill count and value is number of times that count has been reached
- shadows in options menu

- Move screenshots into an editor tool
- Check what else was using the editor interface
- Add a tool to record your movement and run it back
  - capture N key frames per second while moving, discard ones with no movement
  - run back with scrub slider and lerp
  - need to collect a key frame whenever the inputs change, like on interaction

### Ideas for v2

These are ideas for features that would be nice to have but are not critical for the first release.

- falling damage
	- need to calculate time spent falling - off the floor and moving downwards, needs to move > X units and stop abruptly
- random spawn points as flag on level
- campaign select will depend on campaign discovery
- campaign background scene
	- It would be a level that didn't close the start menu
- add an option to holster your weapon when starting dialogue

### Player Testing

I did some playtesting and collected feedback on what needed to be improved.

- Reduce jump cost
- Option for player footsteps in subtitles
- Add a way to return to the main menu
- More interactive items in the levels
