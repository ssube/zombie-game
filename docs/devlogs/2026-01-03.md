### Summary

I made menu buttons more consistent - the back, apply, confirm, quit, etc buttons along the bottom of menus are now horizontal. The main menu and pause menu are exceptions with a vertical layout.

I converted all sounds to OGG format since it's smaller than WAV and more open than MP3.

I added a consumable component with action node and action condition. I also added a global group for named markers that will be combined with predefined level markers and allows entities to add markers to the level.

I added a menu action node that allows an interactive item to show a menu, like the Resident Evil style save/load menu.

The input system now detects continuous attacks using is-pressed instead of is-just-pressed logic. It includes edge detection: attack starting, attack ending, and attack duration. This can be used for charged attacks, machine guns, flame throwers, etc.

I fixed a bug where throttle nodes were passing the single frame delta instead of the accumulated delta. I also added level markers stored by name, which caches existing level marker nodes and adds methods to add/remove custom markers.

### Progress

- make menu buttons more consistent
	- the back, apply, confirm, quit, etc buttons along the bottom of menus are now horizontal
	- the main menu and pause menu are exceptions with a vertical layout
- convert all sounds to OGG
	- smaller than WAV, more open than MP3
- pass an accurate delta to throttled actions, branches, etc
	- throttle nodes should pass the _accumulated_ delta, not the single frame delta
- store level markers by name
	- this both caches the existing level marker nodes and adds methods to add/remove custom markers while the level is loaded
	- markers are cleared when the level changes
- consumable component
	- with action node and action condition
	- observers or system to remove consumed items?
		- not all of them will be removed:
			- a potion produces an empty bottle
			- a scroll is consumed and gone
			- a wand will exist but do nothing
		- should probably be an action event or something like that
			- what if action events were scoped by component?
				- damage and death would be Health.Damage and Health.Death, etc?
- add a global group for named markers
	- will be combined with predefined level markers
	- allows entities to add markers to the level
	- removed when the level changes
- add a menu action node
	- allows an interactive item to show a menu, like the Resident Evil style save/load menu
- the input system now detects continuous attacks
	- uses is-pressed instead of is-just-pressed logic
	- includes edge detection: attack starting, attack ending, attack duration
	- can be used for charged attacks, machine guns, flame throwers, etc

### TODOs

- [x] bug: stamina getting stuck at 0 in web release build
	- while playing on the fishing pier level, after depleting my stamina, it never recharged
	- no errors or relevant debug logs, happens randomly

### Next Up

- [x] path follow system
	- adjust velocity to follow curve
	- start a timer when velocity reaches 0
	- nudge the velocity when the timer times out
- [x] improve the zombie movement and behavior
	- they are slow to turn and often lose track of the player
	- they randomly stop or get distracted
- [x] add a logging library, but a simple one
	- could be a singleton with a single level for now
	- needs to have a timestamp, level, and message
	- interpolation can be done after the level check, using varargs: `func (msg: String, args: ...) { print(msg % args) }`
- move all of the entity utils that require a specific entity type to be a method on that type
	- if it takes an `actor: ZE_Character`, it's not a utility, it's a method

### Ideas

- more action wrappers:
	- add some temporal actions:
		- throttle
		- debounce
	- add some counter actions:
		- skip first N
		- skip after N - how to persist this? can it consume a charge on an entity somewhere?
- move actions out of nodes folder
	- actions, conditions, loops, objectives, triggers
- level locked flag
	- disable in select menu
	- this would be part of the campaign level resource
	- persist locking with save game? or player profile? game options?
