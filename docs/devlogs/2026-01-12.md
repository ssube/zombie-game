### Summary

I was able to fix some of the issues from the recent player testing today, especially some of the damage balancing for the crowbar. It now takes significantly less damage when hitting surfaces in the world, and no damage at all for some surfaces. It also does more damage to the zombies. The regular zombies have a little bit less health, as well, making them much easier to fit in melee combat.

There is now a minimum threshold to how far adaptive aim will turn the gun. This is set to 2.5 meters or about 8 feet, and cannot be configured in the options yet. Having a minimum prevents the gun from turning in strange directions when you look straight up or are standing up against a wall. It also looks more natural now when you aim between targets at different distances.

I also made a few fixes to the weapon physics. The crowbar, baseball bat, and others now collide with the floating cardboard boxes in the water off of the fishing pier. The shotgun has physics turned off while it's being held and should no longer push other items through the floor.

I've started adding sections to the main menu for contact info, including bug reports, as well as credits for the assets and licenses for the other dependencies. The contact info includes links, which will open in your browser. The credits are scrollable and will include all of the open source licenses for the libraries that I'm using, with links to them and to the asset packs.

Finally, I found a sound to use when the player is exhausted, but it includes a few different tired sighs in the same clip. I need to cut that up into multiple sound effects tomorrow and then set them up to play randomly when the player tries to perform an action that they don't have enough stamina for.

### Progress

- [x] limit how far adaptive aim can turn the gun on the near side (weird behavior against walls)
	- limited it to 25% of the maximum length, or 2.5m (about 8ft)
- [x] fix crowbar using the bat's break sound effect
- [x] fix buttons on new save menu positioned wrong
- ~~add F key shortcut for interact (right click was not intuitive)~~
	- this was already implemented and shown in the controls, the player did not check and I forgot to point it out
	- the game will have a tutorial to explain more of the controls
- [x] increase melee weapon damage or decrease zombie health
- [x] decrease the damage that surfaces do to the crowbar
- [x] fix the crowbar not colliding with the floating cardboard boxes
- [x] shotgun has too much physics, pushing medkits through the floor
	- equipment items should have a flag for whether they are frozen static, kinematic, or not at all
- [x] make sure that all of the lights with shadows enabled also have a shadow group set
- [x] add contact and credits to the menu
- [x] play pickup sound when getting items out of a container
	- there is already a sound being played when you use the container, which I made louder
	- I'm hoping that the increased volume combined with the different styles for message history (subtitles in italics, actions in bold, or something like that) will be enough to differentiate these for people
- [x] found a sound for when the player is exhausted

### TODOs

#### Feedback and Polish

- [ ] add a sound when the player is exhausted and cannot perform an action
	- [ ] cut up the sound clip into the individual sighs
	- [ ] randomly play them (or use the best one with a variable sound node)
- [ ] color code the actions in the top bar (player missed the shotgun notification)
	- having a ~~menu action~~ message class might be helpful, containing
		- timestamps (sent, received)
		- color/style
		- message text
		- icon
		- category
	- these are the basic fields for any sort of chat history or multiplayer chat, and can be used for world interactions and subtitles as well
	- this should probably be a component with a relationship to the player
	- different message categories can be shown in different places on the UI
		- subtitles near the top or bottom
		- chat in a window
		- etc
	
#### Other Player Testing Bugs

- [ ] bullet holes appear on the invisible walls (assign no decal to them)
	- they are currently part of the worldspawn entity, along with the buildings and grass, all of which need to be split up into their own entities
- [ ] curb near the red car in bus stop level is not walkable
- [ ] creating a new save with an existing name does not ask if you want to replace the previous one

#### Tech Demo Prep

- [ ] prepare the list of resource credits for the demo
- [ ] populate the contact menu
- [ ] populate the credits menu
- [ ] fix zombie equipment errors ("Unable to equip weapon: ZombieMelee")
- [ ] cars need to emit sounds more often (attention system)

### Next Up

- [ ] move the durability component to items or the top level
- [ ] quick save and quick load hotkeys
- [ ] add a `spawn` console command
- [ ] actions refactor (move to own folder, use context class)
- [ ] start splitting up readme into sections
- [ ] push assets to a private repo with build automation
- [ ] figure out why the durability action has its own surface type map, duplicating the one in the durability component
- [ ] promote more enums into the utils/enums file
- [ ] set up a Google Form for bug reports
- [ ] set up a Github Issue template for
	- [ ] bug reports
	- [ ] feature requests
